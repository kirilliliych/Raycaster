# Raycaster
The program is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.

***
## What does the project do
This is an implementation of raycasting technique written on C++ language. [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) was used for
displaying the result on the screen.

***
## Why is the project useful
Raycasting is quite simple way of creating pseudo 3D object on 2D plane. It requires much less resources than raycasting and is easier
to implement. Despite this, the final picture is quite pleasing to the eye!

***
## How to launch
```c++
   $ git clone https://github.com/kirilliliych/Raycaster.git
   $ make
```
